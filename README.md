My First Project was inspired by a family friend who I recently came across through my mother. They have been friends for over 30 years and she told me of her story. I quickly gathered information of hers to create this project. It is a website for a woman veteran who served in the Army and used their resources to create a business of her own. Cleaning for almost 20 years, she achieves exceptional work and spreads happiness and healthy lifestyle through her work passion.

This website allows you to make communication more simple by inputting your information and choosing times that best work for the clients. Making it easy for the customer who can not always be close to their cellular devices for calls or text messages. Receiving emails can be more efficient.

Technologies used: .html, .css, bootstrap.

Ideas of improvement: 1. Better styling and better at having my HTML aligned properly.
                      2. More communication from the client who wants the website.
                      3. Challenge myself to create something, even if I feel like it is not good enough.

User Stories:
