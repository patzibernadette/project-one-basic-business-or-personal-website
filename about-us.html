       As years went on her work became more and more creating a weeks full of work with no help. Making her quit her job, it was in 2008 when she could no longer to do her job without help, so she pursued a different career.</p>
    <p class=>As she created more and more work, she received her citizenship and went on to serve the United States in 2007, putting a pause to her business. She gained knowledge through the Army, receiving classes to become a businesswoman and expand what she had created back home.
       Serving a 4 year contract and residing back to Texas she re-opened her cleaning business creating so many more opportunities from the schooling the Army provided for her.
